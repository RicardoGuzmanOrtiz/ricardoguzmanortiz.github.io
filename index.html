            His noteworthy contributions included being part of a team that designed a groundbreaking shirt capable of monitoring health metrics such as heart rates and electrocardiograms in real-time.

 Over the course of four years, he successfully led his team in a dynamic production environment.<br>

In 2020, Ricardo made a bold entrepreneurial move by acquiring a restaurant in the quaint town of Whitelaw. Not just limited to management, he passionately engages in the culinary aspect, personally overseeing much of the cooking. Concurrently, he has taken classes to further his education with the aspiration of returning to programming, a field he genuinely enjoys.
